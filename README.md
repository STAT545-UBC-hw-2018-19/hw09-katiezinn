STAT 547 - HW 09

=============

# Hello! 

## Welcome to my 9th homework assignment.

In this assignment, I added to Shaun Jackman and Jenny Bryan's **Automating Data-analysis Pipelines** activity. The first thing I did was add an r script called [last_letter.r](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/last_letter.r). This r script contains code that counts the frequency of each letter used as the last letter in a word. I then updated my [Makefile](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/Makefile) to create a [.tsv table](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/last_letter.tsv) from my r script. From that file, I further edited my Makefile to produce a [.png file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/last_letter.png) of the .tsv table. Lastly, I created a file called [report2.rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/report2.Rmd) which displays the .png file, and was further rendered through the makefile into an [html file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/report2.html) and [.md file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/report2.md).

## For this assignment I completed the following parts: 

1) Add one R script. ([last_letter.r](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/last_letter.r)) :heavy_check_mark:
2) Add one Rmd script. ([report2.rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/report2.Rmd)) :heavy_check_mark:
3) Add them to the make pipeline by modifying the Makefile.([Makefile](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-katiezinn/blob/master/Makefile)) :heavy_check_mark:
4) Each file should have some output. (.html, .png, .tsv) :heavy_check_mark:
5) Your additions need to be tied to the existing pipeline. :heavy_check_mark:
6) Your additions should correspond to some analysis. :heavy_check_mark:
7) Be deliberate with your dependencies, output, and instructions in your Makefile. :heavy_check_mark:
8) Running make all should result in having all output present in your repo. :heavy_check_mark:
9) Running make clean should remove all output. :heavy_check_mark:
10) There shouldnâ€™t be any useless output, such as an Rplots.pdf file. :heavy_check_mark:

*The files that I added to or changed in this repository include Makefile, README.md, report2.rmd, last_letter.r, last_letter.tsv, last_letter.png, report2.html, and report2.md*

**I would like to note** that this respository was initially seeded with [this](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/make-activity) activity. I added to it to meet requirements for the [STAT 547](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw09/hw09.html) course at UBC. The original activity for the original file can be found [here](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/automation04_make-activity.html).
